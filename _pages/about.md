I am a Research Engineer at **DLR's Institute for Mechatronics and Robotics**, working on an inspiring assistive robotics system called [EDAN](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11670) that can help users with motor impairments carry out everyday tasks. Before that, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at **NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory** ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ working on robotic autonomy for the DARPA RACER Challenge. I also interned at the **University of Edinburgh's SLMC Group** where I helped create a mobile humanoid robot called [EVA](https://youtu.be/nMkcBbofDY0). 

I graduated with First Class Honours in a Bachelor of (Mechatronic (Space)) Engineering and a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Physics) from the **University of Sydney** in 2023. As an undergraduate, I undertook several internships in parallel with my studies, working with the **Max Planck Institute of Astronomy**, **University of Cambridge**, **Cochlear**, **Australian National University**, and **Saber Astronautics**.

I am very passionate about robotics and machine learning, and how these fields can advance and benefit humanity in a wide range of settings from space exploration to healthcare. On a personal note, I was born and raised in Australia, and enjoy playing music, film photography, cinema, oil painting, and seeing the world. Feel free to get in contact!

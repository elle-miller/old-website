I am a PhD student in the [Statistical Learning and Motor Control Group](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc) and the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/) investigating multi-modal reinforcement learning for contact-rich manipulation and physical human-robot interaction, funded by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in [Robotics and Autonomous Systems](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/). 

Previously I was a Research Engineer at **DLR's Institute for Mechatronics and Robotics**, working on an inspiring assistive robotics system called [EDAN](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11670) and before that, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at **NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory** working on robotic autonomy for the DARPA RACER Challenge. Along the way I also helped create a mobile humanoid robot called [EVA](https://youtu.be/nMkcBbofDY0). 

I graduated with First Class Honours in a Bachelor of (Mechatronic (Space)) Engineering and a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Physics) from the **University of Sydney** in 2023. As an undergraduate, I undertook several internships in parallel with my studies, working with the **Max Planck Institute of Astronomy**, **University of Cambridge**, **Cochlear**, **Australian National University**, and **Saber Astronautics**.

I am very passionate about robotics and machine learning, and how these fields can advance and benefit humanity in a wide range of settings from space exploration to healthcare. On a personal note, I was born and raised in Australia, and enjoy playing music, film photography, cinema, oil painting, and seeing the world. Feel free to get in contact!

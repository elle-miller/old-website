I am a Research Engineer at DLR's Institute for Mechatronics and Robotics, working on an inspiring assistive robotics system called [EDAN](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11670). Before that, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on autonomous robotic vehicle for the DARPA RACER Challenge. I also interned at the University of Edinburgh's SLMC Group where I helped create a mobile humanoid robot called [EVA](https://youtu.be/nMkcBbofDY0). Prior to that, I worked on theoretical astrophysics with the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy.

I graduated with First Class Honours in a Bachelor of (Mechatronic (Space)) Engineering and a Bachelor of Advanced Science (Physics) from the University of Sydney in 2023. As an undergraduate, I undertook several internships in parallel with my studies, working with the Max Planck Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, Cochlear, Australian National University, and Saber Astronautics.

I am very passionate about robotics and how they can advance and benefit humanity in a wide range of settings, from space exploration to healthcare.
